Example Code:
Fixed architecture: 3 convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (32 → 64 → 128), each followed by a MaxPooling2D layer.
Includes a Dropout layer after the convolutional layers to reduce overfitting.
Output layer uses softmax activation for a 2-class classification problem (Dense(2, activation='softmax')).
